      <p>Welcome! I&rsquo;m so happy you are here!&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m Jessie, a world traveler, entrepreneur, and personal branding &amp; social media strategist. I am passionate about helping entrepreneurs connect to their ideal clients and superfans in an authentic and powerful way through social media.<br /><br />Whether you are a: real estate agent, network marketer, life or career coach, independent agent or consultant, fitness instructor, music teacher or aspiring influencer, personal branding is what sets you apart from the competition within your spheres of influence. With the right social media strategy, you can use your personal brand to position yourself as an authority in your niche, gain trust, increase your influence, and work <em>only</em> with your ideal clients.</p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s no secret that the way major businesses collect consumer data and then advertise on social media is powerful, but did you know it&rsquo;s possible for an entrepreneur or small business to harness that same power by properly branding and positioning themselves on social media? This is how to attract an audience full of ideal clients and superfans without any of the expensive data collection.<br /><br />Gaining trust with your audience has less to do with algorithms and aggregate data and more to do with how you market and advertise yourself on social media. That&rsquo;s why I set out to create a space for entrepreneurs and small business owners to learn all about the best way to brand themselves, and market &amp; advertise on social media in an authentic and powerful way.</p>
      <p>I help entrepreneurs just like you redefine success on their own terms. Empowering you with the mindset necessary to push through the hard times and algorithm changes, the know-how to create a personal brand from zero, and the skills to market and advertise to a tribe of loyal followers. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are taking your first step or you&rsquo;ve been at it for a while, the Jessie Adventures Around community is all about the do-it-yourself entrepreneur. You will find the tools and resources you need to launch (or re-launch!) your personal brand, the knowledge and support to keep leveling up in your business, and the inspiration to get up every day and do the work!!</p>
