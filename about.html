      <p>I&rsquo;m Jessie, the creative voice behind Jessie Adventures Around!&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last 7 years traveling and living around the globe everywhere from the USA, to Europe, Asia, and back again.&nbsp; For me, travel has been a life lesson on mindset.&nbsp; My brain shifted gears into an adventure mode and suddenly, a whole new world was opened up to me!&nbsp; I was examining parts of myself to see what was really an essential part of my being and what was given to me by society.&nbsp; I started trying new foods and sleeping in strange places.&nbsp; I was communicating with people without language and learning to accept customs as different, not right or wrong.&nbsp; I learned to view religions as cultural interpretations of the same basic message: Be good.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my favorite thing about travel, it gets you so far out of your comfort zone, you create a whole new comfort zone&hellip;and then realize that even that comfort zone is limiting you!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all about that perspective shift.&nbsp; Once I realized how my limiting beliefs and my limited knowledge was shaping my <em>future</em> by influencing almost every decision I made, my whole life changed.&nbsp; My definition of success and happiness changed; and <em>THAT</em> changed my life.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; I am so passionate about helping others bust out of their comfort zones and pursue the life of their dreams!&nbsp; My approach to pursuing goals is a lot like my approach to travel - choose where you want to go, figure out a way to get there, and make sure you do everything you can to enjoy the trip!&nbsp; I make finding the joy along the journey a big goal because travel taught me to be present and enjoy your situation for what it is at any given moment.&nbsp; That isn&rsquo;t to say that there isn&rsquo;t hard work and long days involved, but ask any traveler why they put up with the headaches&hellip; it&rsquo;s because the trip is always worth the difficult things it takes to get there.&nbsp; Goals are a lot like that; hard to get to, but worth it in the end!</p>
      <p>When I moved back to the United States for the first time, I had a completely different definition of what success looked like for my life, so I decided to be bold and figure out a new career path that would allow me the flexibility to travel and live life on my terms.&nbsp; I had already boldly quit my career in genetic research to live in Italy for three years, why not be bold again and just chase a new career that was more aligned with my new definition of success?&nbsp;</p>
      <p>That&rsquo;s exactly what I did and I want to help you do the same thing for yourself.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Unless you do something to get yourself into your own version of a dream life, it will remain just that - a dream life, not your real life.&nbsp; You can set aside your limiting beliefs, acquire the skills and knowledge you need to pursue a career path or second income stream that allows you to move towards your dream life.&nbsp; I did, and I was no different than you are right now!&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The truth is, finding what you want out of life and then having the courage to chase it is something <em>only</em> you can do.&nbsp; It takes some inspiration, a little guidance, a lot of courage, but you are the only one who can do it for yourself&hellip; but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you are meant to do it <em>by yourself</em>!&nbsp;</p>
